# Minimal Next Starter

> An opinionated, super minimal Next.js starter template, alternative to `create-next-app`'s template.

## Features

- ⚡️ Super fast lint / formatting with [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).
- 🌚 Dark mode support with [Next Themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).
- ⭐️ Full ESM setup.
- 🔐 Strict TypeScript configuration.
- ✍️ Geist Font pre-configured.
- ✨ Pre-configured with GitHub Actions for CI.
- 💅 Tailwind plugins like `typography` and `aspect-ratio` pre-installed.

The aim of this starter is to provide a super bare-bones setup for Next.js with all of the necessary things that you might need to get started with a new project.
